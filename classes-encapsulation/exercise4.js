   1. Go to the MDN javascript documentation online
      and lookup "Array".

   2. What are all the STATIC properties and methods
      on the Array Object?

   Static properties and methods on the Array object are those that are accessed directly on the Array constructor itself, rather than on an instance of the Array. Some of the static properties and methods on the Array object include:

   - Array.length: Returns the number of arguments passed to the Array constructor.
   - Array.from(): Creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.
   - Array.isArray(): Determines whether the passed value is an Array.
   - Array.of(): Creates a new Array instance with a variable number of elements.

   3. What are all the INSTANCE properties and methods
      on Array instances?

   Instance properties and methods on Array instances are those that are accessed on an instance of the Array. Some of the instance properties and methods on Array instances include:

   - Array.prototype.length: Reflects the number of elements in an array.
   - Array.prototype.concat(): Returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.
   - Array.prototype.push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
   - Array.prototype.pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

   4. Explain why some of these are static and why some
      are instance fields/properties/methods

   Static properties and methods are used when the functionality is not specific to a particular instance of the Array, but rather applies to the Array constructor itself or to general array operations. Instance properties and methods, on the other hand, are used when the functionality is specific to a particular instance of the Array and operates on that instance's data.
