/*
    Arrays are used in programming to store and manipulate similar collections of data. 
    They allow us to store multiple values in a single variable, making it easier to manage and access the data. 
    Arrays provide various methods and properties that enable us to perform operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.
    They are essential for tasks such as iterating over a set of values, sorting, filtering, and searching. 
    In this code, we can use an array to store the vegetable names instead of individual variables.
